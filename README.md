# Griptape Tool Template

A Github template repository for creating Griptape tools.

## Usage

This template repository defines the typical structure for a Griptape tool and is meant to be used as a starting point when developing new tools. To create a tool using this template, click the **"Use this template"** button at the top of the repository.

### Steps for creating a new Griptape tool:

1. Add your tool's logic to `tool.py`
2. Add tests in the `tests/` directory
3. Add examples in the `examples/` directory
4. Update the contents of `manifest.yml` with the name and description of your tool along with your contact information
5. Rewrite this `README.md` with information about your new tool
6. Choose the appropriate license (and update the `LICENSE` file if necessary)
7. Tell us about your new tool [in Discord](https://discord.gg/gnWRz88eym)!
